This repository contains the common [Danger][] configuration shared by many [Capistrano][] projects. Our goal is to use Danger to speed up the Capistrano PR review process by automating some simple but common code review chores. Contributors get feedback faster, maintainers have to do less work; everyone wins!

The Dangerfile enforces the following pull request policies:

* All non-trivial changes should have a CHANGELOG entry
* Code changes should be accompanied by tests

If you have other suggestions, please let us know!
